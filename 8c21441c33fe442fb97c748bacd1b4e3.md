## [**Refine** - A React-based framework for building internal tools, rapidly](https://refine.dev/)
refine is a React-based framework for rapid building of internal tools. It's is a a collection of helper hooks, components and providers. They are all decoupled from your UI components and business logic, so they never keep you from customizing your UI or coding your own flow.

Refine offers lots of out-of-the box functionality for rapid development, without compromising extreme customizability. Use-cases include, but are not limited to admin panels, B2B applications and dashboards.
