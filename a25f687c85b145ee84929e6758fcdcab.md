## [**K9S** - Kubernetes CLI To Manage Your Clusters In Style!](https://k9scli.io/)
K9s is a terminal based UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters. The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage your deployed applications in the wild. K9s continually watches Kubernetes for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources.

## [**KluCtl**](https://kluctl.io/)
Kluctl is the missing glue to put together large Kubernetes deployments.
It allows you to declare and manage small, large, simple and/or complex multi-env and multi-cluster deployments.
Kluctl does not have cluster-side dependencies and works out of the box.

## [**Kubernetes Lens**](https://github.com/lensapp/lens)
Lens IDE provides the full situational awareness for everything that runs in Kubernetes. It's lowering the barrier of entry for people just getting started and radically improving productivity for people with more experience.

## [**Octant**](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant)
Octant is a tool for developers to understand how applications run on a Kubernetes cluster. It aims to be part of the developer's toolkit for gaining insight and approaching complexity found in Kubernetes. Octant offers a combination of introspective tooling, cluster navigation, and object management along with a plugin system to further extend its capabilities.
