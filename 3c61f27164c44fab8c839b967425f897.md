Server communication technologies

# Server communication technologies

## [**GraphQL vs gRPC**](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/11/28/when-to-use-grpc-vs-graphql/)
gRPC was released in 2016 by Google as an efficient and developer-friendly method of server-to-server communication. GraphQL was released in 2015 by Meta as an efficient and developer-friendly method of client-server communication. They both have significant advantages over REST and have a lot in common. We’ll spend most of the article comparing their traits, and then we’ll summarize each protocol’s strengths and weaknesses. At the end, we’ll know why each is such a good fit for its intended domain and when we might want to use one in the other’s domain.

## [**REST vs. GraphQL vs. gRPC**](https://www.baeldung.com/rest-vs-graphql-vs-grpc)
REST, a good fit for domains, can be easily described as a set of resources as opposed to actions. Making use of HTTP methods enables standard CRUD operations on those resources. By relying on HTTP semantics, it's intuitive to its callers, making it a good fit for public-facing interfaces. Good caching support for REST makes it suitable for APIs with stable usage patterns and geographically distributed users.

GraphQL is a good fit for public APIs where multiple clients require different data sets. Therefore, GraphQL clients can specify the exact data they want through a standardized query language. It is also a good choice for APIs that aggregate data from multiple sources and then serve it to multiple clients.

The gRPC framework is a good fit when developing internal APIs with frequent interaction between microservices. It is commonly used for collecting data from low-level agents like different IoT devices. However, its limited browser support makes it difficult to use in customer-facing web applications.
