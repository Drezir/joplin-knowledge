Microservices, by their networked nature, provide more points of failure than a traditional monolith. As a result of this, we need a different, broader approach to testing.\\\n\\\n## [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/)\\\nPact is a code-first tool for testing HTTP and message integrations using contract tests. Contract tests assert that inter-application messages conform to a shared understanding that is documented in a contract. Without contract testing, the only way to ensure that applications will work correctly together is by using expensive and brittle integration tests.\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":863}]"
