# Messaging

## [**Apache pulsar**](https://pulsar.apache.org/)
Apache Pulsar is a cloud-native, multi-tenant, high-performance solution for server-to-server messaging and queuing built on the publisher-subscribe (pub-sub) pattern. Pulsar combines the best features of a traditional messaging system like RabbitMQ with those of a pub-sub system like Apache Kafka – scaling up or down dynamically without downtime. It's used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, microservices, instant messaging, data integrations, and more.

## [**Memphis**](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-broker)
A simple, robust, and durable cloud-native message broker wrapped with
an entire ecosystem that enables cost-effective, fast, and reliable development of modern queue-based use cases.

Memphis enables the building of modern queue-based applications that require
large volumes of streamed and enriched data, modern protocols, zero ops, rapid development,
extreme cost reduction, and a significantly lower amount of dev time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.

## [**Red panda**](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/)
Redpanda is a streaming data platform for developers. Kafka® API-compatible. ZooKeeper® free. JVM free. We built it from the ground up to eliminate complexity common to Apache Kafka, improve performance by up to 10x, and make the storage architecture safer, more resilient. The simpler devex lets you can focus on your code (instead of fighting Kafka) and develop new use cases that were never before possible. The business benefits from a significantly lower total cost and faster time to market. A new platform that scales with you from the smallest projects to petabytes of data distributed across the globe!
