## [**Apache pulsar**](https://pulsar.apache.org/)
Apache Pulsar is a cloud-native, multi-tenant, high-performance solution for server-to-server messaging and queuing built on the publisher-subscribe (pub-sub) pattern. Pulsar combines the best features of a traditional messaging system like RabbitMQ with those of a pub-sub system like Apache Kafka â€“ scaling up or down dynamically without downtime. It's used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, microservices, instant messaging, data integrations, and more.

## [**Memphis**](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-broker)
A simple, robust, and durable cloud-native message broker wrapped with
an entire ecosystem that enables cost-effective, fast, and reliable development of modern queue-based use cases.

Memphis enables the building of modern queue-based applications that require
large volumes of streamed and enriched data, modern protocols, zero ops, rapid development,
extreme cost reduction, and a significantly lower amount of dev time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.
