body_diff: "[{\"diffs\":[[1,\"# Consider static factory methods instead of constructors\\\n\\\n## Pros\\\n1. One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they have names\\\n`BigInteger(int, int, Random)` vs\\\n`BigInteger.probablePrime`\\\n2. A second advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time they’re invoked\\\n`Boolean.valueOf(boolean)` which returns same objects `Boolean.FALSE` and `Boolean.TRUE`\\\n3. A third advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of their return type\\\n4. A fourth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned\\\nobject can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters\\\n5. A fifth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object\\\nneed not exist when the class containing the method is written\\\n\\\n## Cons\\\n1. The main limitation of providing only static factory methods is that\\\nclasses without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed\\\n2. A second shortcoming of static factory methods is that they are hard for\\\nprogrammers to find\\\n\\\n## Usage\\\n- from—A type-conversion method that takes a single parameter and returns a\\\ncorresponding instance of this type, for example:\\\n`Date d = Date.from(instant);`\\\n- of—An aggregation method that takes multiple parameters and returns an in-\\\nstance of this type that incorporates them, for example:\\\n`Set<Rank> faceCards = EnumSet.of(JACK, QUEEN, KING);`\\\n- valueOf—A more verbose alternative to from and of, for example:\\\n`BigInteger prime = BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE;`\\\n- instance or getInstance—Returns an instance that is described by its pa-\\\nrameters (if any) but cannot be said to have the same value, for example:\\\n`StackWalker luke = StackWalker.getInstance(options);`\\\n- create or newInstance—Like instance or getInstance, except that the\\\nmethod guarantees that each call returns a new instance, for example:\\\n`Object newArray = Array.newInstance(classObject, arrayLen);`\\\n- getType—Like getInstance, but used if the factory method is in a different\\\nclass. Type is the type of object returned by the factory method, for example:\\\n`FileStore fs = Files.getFileStore(path);`\\\n- newType—Like newInstance, but used if the factory method is in a different\\\nclass. Type is the type of object returned by the factory method, for example:\\\n`BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(path);`\\\n- type—A concise alternative to getType and newType, for example:\\\n`List<Complaint> litany = Collections.list(legacyLitany);`\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":2553}]"
