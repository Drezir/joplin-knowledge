An open-source Kubernetes security platform for your clusters, CI/CD pipelines, and IDE that seperates out the security signal from the scanner noise

Kubescape is an open-source Kubernetes security platform, built for use in your day-to-day workflow, by fitting into your clusters, CI/CD pipelines and IDE. It serves as a one-stop-shop for Kuberenetes security and includes vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning. You can run scans via the CLI, or add the Kubescape Helm chart, which gives an in-depth view of what is going on in the cluster.

Kubescape includes misconfiguration and vulnerability scanning as well as risk analysis and security compliance indicators. All results are presented in context and users get many cues on what to do based on scan results.Targeted at the DevSecOps practitioner or platform engineer, it offers an easy-to-use CLI interface, flexible output formats, and automated scanning capabilities. It saves Kubernetes users and admins precious time, effort, and resources.

Kubescape scans clusters, YAML files, and Helm charts. It detects misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks (including NSA-CISA, MITRE ATT&CKÂ® and the CIS Benchmark).
