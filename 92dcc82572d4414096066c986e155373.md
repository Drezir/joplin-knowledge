Now, built into kubectl as apply -k.\\\n\\\n## [**Tilt** - A toolkit for fixing the pains of microservice development.](https://tilt.dev/)\\\nTilt automates all the steps from a code change to a new process: watching files, building container images, and bringing your environment up-to-date.

We call these stages the path to production.\\\n\\\nCartographer separates controls between two usersâ€”one who is responsible for defining a supply chain and who is known as an App Operator, and the application creator, called the Developer. These roles are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but they provide the ability to create separation concerns, which means developers can focus on writing code, and platform teams can focus on smoothing and securing their path to production.\\\n\\\n## [**DevSpace**](https://www.devspace.sh/)\\\nDevSpace is an open-source developer tool for Kubernetes that lets you develop and deploy cloud-native software faster.\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":2037}]"
