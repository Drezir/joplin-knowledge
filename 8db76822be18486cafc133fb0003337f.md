## [**Entity listeners**](https://vladmihalcea.com/spring-hibernate-entity-listeners/?utm_source=Vlad+Mihalcea%27s+Newsletter&utm_campaign=a2417adaf0-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_01_16_07_29_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_7a1c643a85-a2417adaf0-219384146)
In this article, we are going to see how we can configure Spring Data to register several Hibernate Entity Listeners that can intercept entity state modifications.

As I explained in this article, JPA also offers an event listening mechanism that you can configure via the @EntityListeners, @PostPersist or @PostUpdate, or PostRemove annotations. However, the JPA solution is way too limited as it doesnâ€™t allow you to interfere with the EntityManager directly.
