Spring & startup speed

[Spring 3.2 & CRaC](https://foojay.io/today/springboot-3-2-crac/)
CRaC is an OpenJDK project that can "snapshot" a running JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and store its state, including your application, to disk. Then, at another point in time, you can restore the JVM from the saved checkpoint back to memory. With this, one can start an application, warm it up, and create a checkpoint. Restoring from the saved checkpoint back to memory mainly relies on disk I/O, which means it is really fast (in the range of milliseconds).

[CDS with Spring Framework 6.1](https://spring.io/blog/2023/12/04/cds-with-spring-framework-6-1)
Class Data Sharing (CDS) helps reduce the startup time and memory footprint of JVMs by caching class metadata in an archive file so that it can be quickly pre-loaded into a newly launched JVM. This accelerates class loading, a significant contributor to startup time. A default CDS archive is pre-packaged with most recent JDK distributions to contain metadata for common JDK classes. You can also create customized CDS archives to speed up the loading of classes in your own applications.
