## [**PingMe** - notifications](https://pingme.lmno.pk/#/)
PingMe is a personal project to satisfy my needs of having alerts, most major platforms have integration to send alerts but it's not always useful, either you are stuck with one particular platform, or you have to do alot of integrations. I needed a small app which i can just call from my backup scripts, cron jobs, CI/CD pipelines or from anywhere to send a message with particular information. And i can ship it everywhere with ease. Hence, the birth of PingMe.
