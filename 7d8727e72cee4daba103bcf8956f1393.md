These roles are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but they provide the ability to create separation concerns, which means developers can focus on writing code, and platform teams can focus on smoothing and securing their path to production.  \"]],\"start1\":798,\"start2\":798,\"length1\":12,\"length2\":912}]"
