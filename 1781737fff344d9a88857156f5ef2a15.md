Apache Doris

## [Apache Doris](https://doris.apache.org/)

Apache Doris is a high-performance, real-time analytic database based on the MPP architecture and is known for its extreme speed and ease of use. It takes only sub-second response times to return query results under massive amounts of data, and can support not only highly concurrent point query scenarios, but also high-throughput complex analytic scenarios. This brief guide will show you how to download the latest stable version of Doris, install and run it on a single node, including creating databases, data tables, importing data and queries, etc.
