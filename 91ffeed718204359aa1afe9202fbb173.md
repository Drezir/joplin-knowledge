Virtual machines

# Virtual machines

## [**TornadoVM**](https://www.tornadovm.org/)
TornadoVM is an open-source software technology that automatically accelerates Java programs on multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.

## [**GraalVM**](https://www.graalvm.org/)

Pros:
- Less memory reserved for the process
Smaller artifacts
- Faster startup
- No “warm-up period” that JIT compiler needs for a new process during the performance isn’t yet optimal

Cons:
- Worse performance compared to a warmed-up JVM, which still beats native compilation easily without the “enterprise edition” of GraalVM
- Much longer build time; the good part is that the webpack step for the frontend feels like a snap :-)
- More complex and fragile build; you certainly can’t expect your app to work once your last compilation issue is cleared in your Java IDE
- Not compatible with the JVM tooling (debugging, JVM agents, configuration)
- Artifacts are no longer platform independent; the “write once, run everywhere” promise is broken to some degree.
