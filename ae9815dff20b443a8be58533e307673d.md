Caching

# Caching

## [**cache2k**](https://cache2k.org/)
cache2k focuses on providing a well engineered in-memory object cache implementation for Java applications.

## [**Terracotta**](https://www.terracotta.org/)
The Terracotta Server provides powerful distributed in-memory data management capabilities for Terracotta products (such as Ehcache and TCStore) and is the backbone for Terracotta clusters.

A Terracotta Server Array can vary from a basic two-node tandem to a multi-node array (Terracotta Server Array (TSA)) providing configurable scale, high performance, and deep failover coverage.

Add distributed caching capabilities to your Ehcache deployment today!

Terracotta additionally offers various other open source projects and code libraries which may be of interest.
