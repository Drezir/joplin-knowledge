You may use it to create Git releases (tag, changelog, assets), announce releases, create additional binaries and files to be published via package managers. JReleaser supports any kind of project regardless of its source language (Java, Node, Rust, Perl, Python, etc), although it provides additional benefits to Java based projects.\\\n\\\n## [Install4j](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html)\\\ninstall4j is a powerful multi-platform Java installer builder that generates native installers and application launchers for Java applications\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":878}]"
