# Java Web

## [**Javalin**](https://javalin.io/)
Javalin is a very lightweight web framework for Kotlin and Java which supports WebSockets, HTTP2 and async requests. Javalinâ€™s main goals are simplicity, a great developer experience, and first class interoperability between Kotlin and Java.

Javalin is more of a library than a framework. Some key points:
- You don't need to extend anything
- There are no @Annotations
- There is no reflection
- There is no other magic; just code.
