# Java releasing

## [**JReleaser**](https://jreleaser.org/)
JReleaser is a release automation tool. Its goal is to simplify creating releases and publishing artifacts to multiple package managers while providing customizable options. However, you may use it with projects that do not require publishing binary assets. You may use it to create Git releases (tag, changelog, assets), announce releases, create additional binaries and files to be published via package managers. JReleaser supports any kind of project regardless of its source language (Java, Node, Rust, Perl, Python, etc), although it provides additional benefits to Java based projects.
