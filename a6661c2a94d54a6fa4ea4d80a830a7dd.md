# Monitoring

## [**Open Source Monitoring and Metrics Landscape**](https://dzone.com/articles/open-source-monitoring-and-metrics-landscape)
Navigate what open source monitoring standards are available, where in the ecosystem they fit, and how interoperable they are with each other.

## [**Jaeger**](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
Monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems

## [**OpenTelemetry**](https://opentelemetry.io/)
High-quality, ubiquitous, and portable telemetry to enable effective observability

## [**Prometheus kube stack**](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack)
Installs the kube-prometheus stack, a collection of Kubernetes manifests, Grafana dashboards, and Prometheus rules combined with documentation and scripts to provide easy to operate end-to-end Kubernetes cluster monitoring with Prometheus using the Prometheus Operator.

## [**Thanos**](https://thanos.io/)
Open source, highly available Prometheus setup with long term storage capabilities.

## [**Graphite**](https://graphiteapp.org/)
Graphite is an enterprise-ready monitoring tool that runs equally well on cheap hardware or Cloud infrastructure. Teams use Graphite to track the performance of their websites, applications, business services, and networked servers. It marked the start of a new generation of monitoring tools, making it easier than ever to store, retrieve, share, and visualize time-series data.

## [**StatsD**](https://github.com/statsd/statsd)
A network daemon that runs on the Node.js platform and listens for statistics, like counters and timers, sent over UDP or TCP and sends aggregates to one or more pluggable backend services (e.g., Graphite).

## [**PinPoint**](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint)
Pinpoint is an APM (Application Performance Management) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java / PHP/PYTHON. Inspired by Dapper, Pinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications.
