# Feature flags

## [**Feature flags strategies**](https://reflectoring.io/rollout-strategies-with-feature-flags/)
Feature flags (or feature toggles) are basically if/else blocks in our application code that control whether or not a feature is available for a specific user. With feature flags, we can decide who gets to see which feature when.

Togglz is an implementation of the Feature Toggles pattern for Java. Feature Toggles are a very common agile development practices in the context of continuous deployment and delivery. The basic idea is to associate a toggle with each new feature you are working on. This allows you to enable or disable these features at application runtime, even for individual users.
