Serialization

# Serialization

## [**Microstream**](https://github.com/microstream-one/microstream)
Store and load any Java Object Graph or Subgraphs partially, Relieved of Heavy-weight JPA. Microsecond Response Time. Ultra-High Throughput. Minimum of Latencies. Create Ultra-Fast In-Memory Database Applications & Microservices.

## [**Chronicle-Wire**](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Wire)
Chronicle Wire is a Wire Format abstraction library, The purpose of Chronicle Wire is to address the following concerns in a consistent manner:
- Seznam polo≈æekApplication configuration. (Using YAML)
- Data serialization (YAML, binary YAML, JSON, Raw binary data, CSV)
- Accessing off-heap memory in a thread-safe manner. (Bind to shared off-heap memory)
- High performance data exchange using binary formats. Only include as much meta data as you need.

## [Jackson-JR](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-jr)
Jackson jr is a compact alternative to full Jackson Databind component. It implements a subset of functionality, for example for cases where:

- Size of jar matters (jackson-jr-objects is bit over 100 kB)
- Startup time matters (jackson-jr has very low initialization overhead)
