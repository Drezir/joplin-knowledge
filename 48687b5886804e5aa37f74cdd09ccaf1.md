# JVM tips & tricks

## [**AppCDS Autogenerate - Sip of Java**](https://inside.java/2022/09/26/sip067/)
AppCDS, application class data-sharing, is an easy way to improve the startup performance of a Java application. This is done by the JVM creating a pre-processed shared archived of classes loaded at startup. Since its initial release, AppCDS has become easier to use, going from a three-step process to a two-step process, and now with JDK 19, AppCDS can be done in a single step. Letâ€™s look at this feature added to AppCDS in JDK 19.

## [**Setting Pre-Allocated Maps and Sets**](https://inside.java/2022/10/24/sip069/)
To address this issue in JDK 19 the static factory method new<TypeName>(int expectedCapacity) (e.g. newHashMap(int expectedCapacity)) was added to HashMap, HashSet and child classes. The new factory method will return a Map or Set with its capacity set based on the default load factory of 0.75. The result of this change is a small but noticeable improvement in performance, as seen in the below table:
