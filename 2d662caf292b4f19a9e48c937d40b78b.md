Testing microservices

# Testing microservices

## [**Testing Strategies for Microservices**](https://dzone.com/articles/testing-strategies-for-microservices)
A microservice application is a group of distributed programs that communicate over networks, occasionally interfacing with third-party services and databases. Microservices, by their networked nature, provide more points of failure than a traditional monolith. As a result of this, we need a different, broader approach to testing.

## [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/)
Pact is a code-first tool for testing HTTP and message integrations using contract tests. Contract tests assert that inter-application messages conform to a shared understanding that is documented in a contract. Without contract testing, the only way to ensure that applications will work correctly together is by using expensive and brittle integration tests.
