# All in one? (platforms)

## [**Devtron** - The DevOps Accelerator](https://devtron.ai/index.html)
Devtron is a tool integration platform for Kubernetes.
Devtron deeply integrates with products across the lifecycle of microservices,i.e., CI, CD, security, cost, debugging, and observability via an intuitive web interface.

## [**Terraform** - Automate Infrastructure on Any Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/)
HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

## [**Knative**](https://knative.dev/docs/)
Knative is a platform-agnostic solution for running serverless deployments. Knative Serving defines a set of objects as Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). These resources are used to define and control how your serverless workload behaves on the cluster.

## [**Flagger**](https://docs.flagger.app/)
Flagger is a progressive delivery tool that automates the release process for applications running on Kubernetes. It reduces the risk of introducing a new software version in production by gradually shifting traffic to the new version while measuring metrics and running conformance tests.
Flagger implements several deployment strategies (Canary releases, A/B testing, Blue/Green mirroring) using a service mesh (App Mesh, Istio, Linkerd, Kuma, Open Service Mesh) or an ingress controller (Contour, Gloo, NGINX, Skipper, Traefik) for traffic routing. For release analysis, Flagger can query Prometheus, InfluxDB, Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch, Stackdriver or Graphite and for alerting it uses Slack, MS Teams, Discord and Rocket.

## [**Nomad**](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad)
A simple and flexible scheduler and orchestrator to deploy and manage containers and non-containerized applications across on-prem and clouds at scale
