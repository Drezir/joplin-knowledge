Now, built into kubectl as apply -k.\\\n\\\n## [**Tilt** - A toolkit for fixing the pains of microservice development.](https://tilt.dev/)\\\nTilt automates all the steps from a code change to a new process: watching files, building container images, and bringing your environment up-to-date. Think docker build && kubectl apply or docker-compose up.\\\n\\\n## [**Telepresence** - FAST, LOCAL DEVELOPMENT FOR KUBERNETES AND OPENSHIFT MICROSERVICES](https://www.telepresence.io/)\\\n- [IntelliJ integration](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2022/06/intellij-idea-2022-2-eap-5/#Intercept_Kubernetes_service_requests_with_Telepresence_integration)\\\n\\\n## [**Skafold** - Fast. Repeatable. Simple. Local Kubernetes Development.](https://skaffold.dev/)\\\nSkaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing and deploying your application, allowing you to focus on what matters most: writing code.\\\n\\\n## [**Cartographer**](https://cartographer.sh/docs/v0.4.0/architecture/)\\\nCartographer allows users to configure Kubernetes resources into reusable supply chains that can be used to define all of the stages that an Application Workload must go through to get to an environment. We call these stages the path to production.\\\n\\\nCartographer separates controls between two usersâ€”one who is responsible for defining a supply chain and who is known as an App Operator, and the application creator, called the Developer. These roles are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but they provide the ability to create separation concerns, which means developers can focus on writing code, and platform teams can focus on smoothing and securing their path to production.\\\n\\\n## [**DevSpace**](https://www.devspace.sh/)\\\nDevSpace is an open-source developer tool for Kubernetes that lets you develop and deploy cloud-native software faster.\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":2012}]"
