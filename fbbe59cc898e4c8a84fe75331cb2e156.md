ReplicaDB helps offload certain tasks, such as ETL or ELT processing, for efficient execution at a much lower cost. ReplicaDB currently works with Oracle, Postgres, SQL Server, MySQL and MariaDB, Denodo, CSV on local files or Amazon S3 and Kafka.

ReplicaDB is Cross Platform; you can replicate data across different platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS), with compatibility for many databases. You can use Parallel data transfer for faster performance and optimal system utilization.
