Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

# Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

## Pros
1. One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they have names
`BigInteger(int, int, Random)` vs
`BigInteger.probablePrime`
2. A second advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time they’re invoked
`Boolean.valueOf(boolean)` which returns same objects `Boolean.FALSE` and `Boolean.TRUE`
3. A third advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of their return type
4. A fourth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned
object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters
5. A fifth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object
need not exist when the class containing the method is written

## Cons
1. The main limitation of providing only static factory methods is that
classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed
2. A second shortcoming of static factory methods is that they are hard for
programmers to find

## Usage
- **from**—A type-conversion method that takes a single parameter and returns a
corresponding instance of this type, for example:
`Date d = Date.from(instant);`
- **of**—An aggregation method that takes multiple parameters and returns an in-
stance of this type that incorporates them, for example:
`Set<Rank> faceCards = EnumSet.of(JACK, QUEEN, KING);`
- **valueOf**—A more verbose alternative to from and of, for example:
`BigInteger prime = BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE;`
- **instance** or **getInstance**—Returns an instance that is described by its pa-
rameters (if any) but cannot be said to have the same value, for example:
`StackWalker luke = StackWalker.getInstance(options);`
- **create** or **newInstance**—Like instance or getInstance, except that the
method guarantees that each call returns a new instance, for example:
`Object newArray = Array.newInstance(classObject, arrayLen);`
- **getType**—Like getInstance, but used if the factory method is in a different
class. Type is the type of object returned by the factory method, for example:
`FileStore fs = Files.getFileStore(path);`
- **newType**—Like newInstance, but used if the factory method is in a different
class. Type is the type of object returned by the factory method, for example:
`BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(path);`
- **type**—A concise alternative to getType and newType, for example:
`List<Complaint> litany = Collections.list(legacyLitany);`
