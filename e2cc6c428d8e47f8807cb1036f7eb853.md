Teams use Graphite to track the performance of their websites, applications, business services, and networked servers. It marked the start of a new generation of monitoring tools, making it easier than ever to store, retrieve, share, and visualize time-series data.\\\n\\\n## [**StatsD**](https://github.com/statsd/statsd)\\\nA network daemon that runs on the Node.js platform and listens for statistics, like counters and timers, sent over UDP or TCP and sends aggregates to one or more pluggable backend services (e.g., Graphite).\\\n\\\n## [**PinPoint**](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint)\\\nPinpoint is an APM (Application Performance Management) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java / PHP/PYTHON. Inspired by Dapper, Pinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications.\\\n\\\n#\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":2319}]"
