## [**PicoCLI**](https://picocli.info/)
Picocli is a one-file framework for creating Java command line applications with almost zero code. It supports a variety of command line syntax styles including POSIX, GNU, MS-DOS and more. It generates highly customizable usage help messages that use ANSI colors and styles to contrast important elements and reduce the cognitive load on the user.

## [**Jarviz**](https://github.com/kordamp/jarviz)
Jarviz is a JAR file analyzer tool. You can obtain metadata from a JAR such as its manifest, manifest entries, bytecode versions, declarative services, Java module descriptors and more.

## [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/)
Ever wanted to just be able to run java from anywhere without any or very minimal setup ? Ever tried out Java 11+ support for running .java files directly in your shell but felt it was a bit too cumbersome?
