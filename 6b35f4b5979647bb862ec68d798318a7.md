This accelerates class loading, a significant contributor to startup time. A default CDS archive is pre-packaged with most recent JDK distributions to contain metadata for common JDK classes. You can also create customized CDS archives to speed up the loading of classes in your own applications.\"]],\"start1\":515,\"start2\":515,\"length1\":8,\"length2\":596}]"
