Deploy tools and tips

## [**Tilt** - A toolkit for fixing the pains of microservice development.](https://tilt.dev/)
Tilt automates all the steps from a code change to a new process: watching files, building container images, and bringing your environment up-to-date. Think docker build && kubectl apply or docker-compose up.

## [**Telepresence** - FAST, LOCAL DEVELOPMENT FOR KUBERNETES AND OPENSHIFT MICROSERVICES](https://www.telepresence.io/)
- [IntelliJ integration](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2022/06/intellij-idea-2022-2-eap-5/#Intercept_Kubernetes_service_requests_with_Telepresence_integration)

## [Geryfa](https://gefyra.dev/)
Blazingly-fast üöÄ, rock-solid, local application development ‚û°Ô∏è with Kubernetes.

## [**Skafold** - Fast. Repeatable. Simple. Local Kubernetes Development.](https://skaffold.dev/)
Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing and deploying your application, allowing you to focus on what matters most: writing code.

## [**Cartographer**](https://cartographer.sh/docs/v0.4.0/architecture/)
Cartographer allows users to configure Kubernetes resources into reusable supply chains that can be used to define all of the stages that an Application Workload must go through to get to an environment. We call these stages the path to production.

Cartographer separates controls between two users‚Äîone who is responsible for defining a supply chain and who is known as an App Operator, and the application creator, called the Developer. These roles are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but they provide the ability to create separation concerns, which means developers can focus on writing code, and platform teams can focus on smoothing and securing their path to production.

## [DevSpace](https://www.devspace.sh/)
DevSpace is an open-source developer tool for Kubernetes that lets you develop and deploy cloud-native software faster.

## [KubeAdm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/)
Kubeadm is a tool built to provide kubeadm init and kubeadm join as best-practice "fast paths" for creating Kubernetes clusters.

kubeadm performs the actions necessary to get a minimum viable cluster up and running. By design, it cares only about bootstrapping, not about provisioning machines. Likewise, installing various nice-to-have addons, like the Kubernetes Dashboard, monitoring solutions, and cloud-specific addons, is not in scope.

Instead, we expect higher-level and more tailored tooling to be built on top of kubeadm, and ideally, using kubeadm as the basis of all deployments will make it easier to create conformant clusters

## [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container ‚Äúnodes‚Äù.
kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.
