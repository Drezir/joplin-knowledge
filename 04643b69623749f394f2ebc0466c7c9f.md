Lightstreamer is a real-time engine that delivers real-time data over HTTP and WebSockets
to/from any types of clients (HTML pages, native mobile applications, desktop applications,
etc.), as well as native push notifications to mobile clients.
By implementing unique features such as Bandwidth & Frequency Throttling and
Adaptive Streaming, Lightstreamer handles the distribution of live data to the clients in a
reliable, light, and efficient way.
Lightstreamer is able to pass through any firewall and proxy by using many sophisticated
mechanisms without the risk of security policy blockages.
