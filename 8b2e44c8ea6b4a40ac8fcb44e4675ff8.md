Microsecond Response Time. Ultra-High Throughput. Minimum of Latencies. Create Ultra-Fast In-Memory Database Applications & Microservices.\\\n\\\n## [**Chronicle-Wire**](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Wire)\\\nChronicle Wire is a Wire Format abstraction library, The purpose of Chronicle Wire is to address the following concerns in a consistent manner:\\\n- Seznam polo≈æekApplication configuration. (Using YAML)\\\n- Data serialization (YAML, binary YAML, JSON, Raw binary data, CSV)\\\n- Accessing off-heap memory in a thread-safe manner. (Bind to shared off-heap memory)\\\n- High performance data exchange using binary formats. Only include as much meta data as you need.\\\n\\\n## [Jackson-JR](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-jr)\\\nJackson jr is a compact alternative to full Jackson Databind component. It implements a subset of functionality, for example for cases where:\\\n\\\n- Size of jar matters (jackson-jr-objects is bit over 100 kB)\\\n- Startup time matters (jackson-jr has very low initialization overhead)\\\n\\\n## [Byte compression](https://www.baeldung.com/java-compress-uncompress-byte-array)\\\nData compression is a crucial aspect of software development that enables efficient storage and transmission of information. In Java, the Deflater and Inflater classes from the java.util.zip package provide a straightforward way to compress and decompress byte arrays.\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1527}]"
