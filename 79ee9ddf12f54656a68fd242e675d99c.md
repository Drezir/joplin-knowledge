Release platforms

# GitOps platforms

## [**FluxCD**](https://fluxcd.io/)
Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.

Flux is built from the ground up to use Kubernetes' API extension system, and to integrate with Prometheus and other core components of the Kubernetes ecosystem. Flux supports multi-tenancy and support for syncing an arbitrary number of Git repositories.

## [**ArgoCD Rollouts**](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/)
Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller and set of CRDs which provide advanced deployment capabilities such as blue-green, canary, canary analysis, experimentation, and progressive delivery features to Kubernetes.

Argo Rollouts (optionally) integrates with ingress controllers and service meshes, leveraging their traffic shaping abilities to gradually shift traffic to the new version during an update. Additionally, Rollouts can query and interpret metrics from various providers to verify key KPIs and drive automated promotion or rollback during an update.

## [**Spinnaker**](https://spinnaker.io/)
Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes with high velocity and confidence.
