## [**Security without WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter**](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-deprecated-websecurityconfigureradapter)
Spring Security allows customizing HTTP security for features such as endpoints authorization or the authentication manager configuration by extending a WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class. However, since recent versions, Spring deprecates this approach and encourages a component-based security configuration.

## [**Spring CSRF**](https://reflectoring.io/spring-csrf/)
Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF, sometimes also called XSRF) is an attack that can trick an end-user using a web application to unknowingly execute actions that can compromise security. To understand what constitutes a CSRF attack, refer to this introductory article. In this article, we will take a look at how to leverage Springâ€™s built-in CSRF support when creating a web application.
